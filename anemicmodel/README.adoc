= Anemic model vs Rich model

Inspired by: https://web-techno.net/anemic-domain-model/

CheckoutService can complete an order.
The order should be validate and a shipment created with products that must decrease from stock.


The anemic model need to have getters and setters for every fields and then, break encapsulation.
Everyone using those objects can modify it without control.

Objects in rich model garanty the object coherence.
In anemic model, this coherence is delegated to the service but it's allow to manipulate object
without using service.
